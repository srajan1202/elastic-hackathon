# CarbonScope: ESG Intelligence Platform


#### Hackathon Project ####
This project was developed for the "Forge the Future" Elasticsearch Hackathon, powered by Elastic and AWS. It showcases how AI and data can be combined to create intelligent search solutions that improve lives and businesses.

#### Project Overview ####
An intelligent real-time search and analytics system that combines Elasticsearch's powerful search capabilities with AI-driven data processing. The system ingests data in real-time, processes it through specialized AI agents, and provides semantic search with intelligent summarization.


#### System Architecture ####


##### Core Components:

1. Real-Time Ingestor: Streams data from various sources via   Amazon SQS
2. Classification Agent: Automatically categorizes incoming data
3. Enrichment Agent: Enhances data with additional context and metadata
4. Vector Search Engine: Performs semantic similarity searches using embeddings
5. Search Agent: Handles intelligent query processing and ranking
6. Summary Agent: Generates concise summaries of search results
7. Chat Interface: Interactive AI-powered search experience

##### Key Features:

1. Semantic Vector Search: Find relevant content based on meaning, not just keywords
2. Real-Time Data Processing: Continuous ingestion and processing of streaming data
3. Multi-Agent AI System: Specialized agents for different data processing tasks
4. Intelligent Summarization: Automatic generation of concise result summaries
